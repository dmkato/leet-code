# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
# 
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
# should be O(log (m+n)).
# 
# You may assume nums1 and nums2Â cannot be both empty.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# nums1 = [1, 3]
# nums2 = [2]
# 
# The median is 2.0
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# nums1 = [1, 2]
# nums2 = [3, 4]
# 
# The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
